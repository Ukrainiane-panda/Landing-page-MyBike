The MyBike landing page is designed for seamless movement both in the physical world and online. During development, I focused on these aspects:

### Clear Structure 🧩:
- Established a solid structure and framework using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) with inspiration from the stylish design [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=0%3A1).
- Followed best practices such as semantic markup principles and the BEM methodology to ensure a clear and organized HTML code structure.

### Visually Appealing Style 🖥️🎨:
- Brought the design to life while maintaining its originality by utilizing SCSS (Sass), an extension of CSS.
- Applied responsive design techniques, including Flexbox and Grid, to ensure an optimal appearance of the web page for all users.

### Dynamic Functionality 🚀:
- Implemented JavaScript to handle URL fragment changes and form submissions smoothly, eliminating the need for page reloads.

### Testing and Debugging 🔍🛠️:
- Testing and debugging were crucial throughout the development process.
- Utilized various techniques, including Chrome DevTools, to inspect and manipulate page elements, analyze network requests, debug JavaScript code, and optimize performance.
- Conducted comprehensive testing and debugging to identify and resolve any issues or bugs, ensuring a seamless and error-free user experience! ✨
