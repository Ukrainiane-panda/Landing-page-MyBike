For the development of the MyBike landing page, I utilized a comprehensive technology stack that incorporated various aspects:

I started by creating the structure and skeleton of the web page based on the design using HTML (HyperText Markup Language). The design, which can be found at the following link: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=0%3A1), served as the foundation for the project. In addition to the development aspects, I also incorporated best practices for maintainability and collaboration. I followed semantic markup principles and applied the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology. This approach allowed for a clear and organized structure of the HTML code, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the project.

To bring the design to life and ensure a visually appealing and consistent appearance, I employed SCSS (Sass), an extension of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This allowed me to style and design the page according to the web designer's vision while preserving the originality of the idea. Additionally, I implemented a responsive design approach, considering various device sizes and ensuring an optimal viewing experience for users.

In terms of functionality, I utilized JavaScript to handle changes in the URL hash fragment and process form submission events without requiring a page reload. By implementing event handlers for `hashchange` and `submit` events, I ensured a seamless and dynamic user experience.

Throughout the development process, testing and debugging played a crucial role. I employed various techniques, including the use of Chrome DevTools. This powerful tool allowed me to inspect and manipulate page elements, analyze network requests, debug JavaScript code, and optimize performance. By conducting thorough testing and debugging, I identified and resolved any issues or bugs, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience. âœ¨
